My name is Rowan Christopher. I'm a plant biologist interested in the interactions between trees and their environments. More specifically, I explore how land use and management strategies affect tree secondary metabolism and growth. 

I’m finishing my bachelors of science in biochemistry & molecular biology at Agnes Scott College with minors in mathematics and environmental & sustainability studies. In the fall, I will be starting my PhD at University of Georgia’s Integrated Plant Sciences program. 

### Check out some of my work:

#### Predicting Carbon Flux from soil temperature, moisture, and microbe biodiversity

Understanding how temperature affects carbon cycling is important when examining the effects of global climate change. Carbon flux is largely driven by photosynthesis and cellular respiration by soil bacteria. This project combines soil temperature, moisture, and microbe species data with carbon flux data in 13 different ecological domains in the United States. The goal is to understand whether soil temperature, moisture, or microbe biodiversity better explains carbon flux variation.
