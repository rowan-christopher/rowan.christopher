My name is Rowan Christopher. I'm a plant biologist interested in the interactions between trees and their environments. More specifically, I explore how land use and management strategies affect tree secondary metabolism and growth. 

I’m finishing my bachelors of science in biochemistry & molecular biology at Agnes Scott College with minors in mathematics and environmental & sustainability studies. In the fall, I will be starting my PhD at University of Georgia’s Integrated Plant Sciences program.
